## 1) New feature/bug fix

If you want to propose a new feature or a bug fix, you should first discuss it on the [mailing list](../mailing-lists.html) (on the users mailing list or on the dev mailing list if you already have a technical proposal).

Then, you should submit a pull request to propose your changes or bug fix.

Any pull request should come with the appropriate documentation and [tests](tests-strategy.html).

## 2) Documentation

If you need to update the documentation (for a new feature/bug fix), you may need to change:

- the `README.md` file

- one or several files in the `documentation` directory: it is published as this website.
You can browse it locally at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) by running: `bundle exec jekyll serve`. Any changes made on the files will be seen immediately.
