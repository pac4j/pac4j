**v3.8.0**:

- QualifiedName must not be included by default in SAML authentication requests
- Added replay protectection to the SAML client.
- Added support for the SAML artifact binding for the authentication response.
- Fix SAML signature validation w.r.t. WantAssertionsSigned handling. Signing is now always required, even when WantAssertionsSigned is disabled. WantAssertionsSigned now requires explicit signing of the assertions, not the response.

**v3.7.0**:

- Fix SAML SP metadata signature
- CAS improvements: better service requests detection, support of the CAS server `method` parameter
- Fix the `CasRestProfile` with JWT
- Add HTTP POST Simple-Sign protocol implementation
- Add the `get`, `post`, `put` and `delete` matchers based on the `HttpMethodMatcher` when not defined

**v3.6.1**:

- Fix Google OAuth support

**v3.6.0**:

- Multiple authn context class refs can be set in the SAML protocol support
- For `Google2Client`, change profile url from `https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/people/me` to `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo`. This change is to prepare for the shutdown of Google plus API. This change will make the `birthday` attribute return `null` and `emails` attribute resolve a single email from `email` attribute for `Google2Client`.
- Clean shutdown of the `SAML2Client` via the `destroy` method
- Do not clear the ID Token as a sensitive data in the `OidcProfile`
- Improve signature and digest methods for SAML metadata
- Enhance OAuth 2 generic support
- Use the NameID as the fallback of the SessionIndex for the SAML SLO support

**v3.5.0**:

- Added `UserInfoOidcAuthenticator` to authenticate a user based on an access token received from an OpenID Connect login process
- Updated the OpenID Connect/JWT dependencies (v6)
- Added `DirectBearerAuthClient`
- Handled the inResponseTo and the RelayState in the logout response (SAML)
- Added `trustedClasses` to the `JavaSerializationHelper`

**v3.4.0**:

- Added ability to create a composition of authorizers (conjunction or disjunction)
- SAML SLO support with SOAP (ingoing only), HTTP-POST and HTTP-Redirect bindings
- OpenID Connect improvements: supports multiple JWS algorithms from the identity server, retrieves the Keycloak roles

**v3.3.0**:

- Improve SAML support: always return a default key which is a private one, add a SingleLogoutService URL in the SP metadata, make local and central logouts work together, allow attributes to be mapped to new names
- Default state generation can be overriden by your own `StateGenerator` for the OAuth, OpenID Connect and SAML protocols
- Custom OpenSAML bootstrapping in SAML authentication module
- X509 certificate support

**v3.2.0**:

- Allow to set the `profileId` for the `GenericOAuth20Client`
- Fixed the `setConfiguration` method name in the OAuth v2.0 support
- Optionally sign or specificy requested attributes in the SAML SP metadata
- Update to Scribejava v5.6.0
- Added support for HiOrg-Server (OAuth)
- Revised OAuth error handling for extracting user profiles. Now, an exception is thrown instead of returning an empty profile
- Fix the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` name and the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header verification

**v3.1.0**:

- Added attribute merging capabilities for the user profile: multiple attributes with the same name and value of the collection type can be merged into a single attribute
- Added Weibo, QQ and Wechat (OAuth) supports

**v3.0.3:**

- `AzureAdClient` uses the `PathParameterCallbackUrlResolver` by default

**v3.0.2**:

- Properly handles all the HTTP codes in the `setResponseStatus` method of the `J2EContext`
- Added the `setExcludedPath` and `setExcludedPattern` methods to the `PathMatcher` class (for Shiro)

**v3.0.1**:

- The `ProfileHelper.flatIntoOneProfile` method returns an `AnonymousProfile` (instead of empty) if it's the only profile

**v3.0.0**:

- Handle AJAX requests in the OpenID Connect logout
- All session interactions are done via the `SessionStore` (retrieved from the `WebContext`)
- All exceptions (especially `HttpAction`) are unchecked
- Upgraded dependencies
- Added "multi-tenancy" capabilities: you can dynamically define multiple callback URLs for the same client, except for SAML for which you need as many `SAML2Client` as the number of different callback URLs you want
- The `CallbackUrlResolver` computes the callback URL (using a query parameter or a path parameter to define the client), based on the `UrlResolver` which computes a URL
- You can define an error (page) URL at the logics' level to handle unexpected exceptions
- The SAML Keystore alias can be defined via a property; SAML date comparisons are now UTC-based
- The client name is not set at the credential's level
- The username of the `AzureAdProfile` is the UPN
- The issue time is generated and an expiration date can be used for a JWT
- The OpenID Connect user profile can be expired
- In the `J2EContext`, header names are checked in a case-insensitive way
- Supports the `javax.faces.partial.ajax` parameter for AJAX requests
- If only one client is defined in the configuration, it is used as a fallback on the security and callback endpoints

**v2.3.1**:

- Saving the profile in session can be disabled on the callback endpoint

**v2.2.1**:

- Improve SAML support: fix generated binding, handle AttributeConsumingServiceIndex in authentication request, add capability to add authentication-related attributes to the user profile with specific attributes added to the profile...

**v2.1.0**:

- Added Kerberos support
- Removed Stormpath support
- The password encoders and LDAP/SQL authenticators can be defined via properties through the `PropertiesConfigFactory`
- Supports CouchDB for authentication and user management
- REST API `Authenticator`
- In case of an unauthorized AJAX request, the redirection URL to the identity server is added as the `Location` header to the 401 error
- Allow passive authentication for SAML

**v2.0.0**:

- All clients are built using sub-components (`RedirectActionBuilder`, `CredentialsExtractor` , `Authenticator`, `ProfileCreator` and `LogoutActionBuilder`): the `IndirectClientV2` and `DirectClientV2` are renamed as `IndirectClient` and `DirectClient` (and the existing `IndirectClient` and `DirectClient` components are removed)
- The  `LdapProfileService`, `DbProfileService` and `MongoProfileService` replace the deprecated `LDapAuthenticator`, `DbAuthenticator` and `MongoAuthenticator` to validate username/password and create, update or delete users in a LDAP, in a relational database and in a MongoDB database
- A user profile can be linked to another user profile
- The `LogoutLogic` (formerly `ApplicationLogoutLogic`) handles the application and identity provider logout
- The `WebContext` directly relies on the `SessionStore` whose capabilities are upgraded to handle back-channel logout
- The `AuthorizationGenerator` takes the `WebContext` as input and can return a new built profile
- Using Spring framework `Resource` components for SAML files/URLs
- The session renewal is properly handled by clients (and especially CAS)
- Caches are backed via a `Store` component
- Upgrade the OAuth support with Scribe v3.3 and rebuild all clients on the generic `OAuth10Client` and `OAuth20Client`
- User profiles are simple POJOs, the `AttributesDefinition` is replaced by the `ProfileDefinition`
- CAS specificities (Kryo serialization, `toString` service ticket validation) are handled via the `InternalAttributeHandler`
- Authenticators may throw the checked `CredentialsException`
- Only two `PasswordEncoder` wrappers are available: one for Spring Security Crypto, the other one for Shiro
- Added new matcher `PathMatcher` and deprecated `ExcludedPathMatcher`
