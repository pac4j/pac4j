**v5.4.0**:

- Deprecated the `pac4j-jee` dependency (JEE components in the `org.pac4j.core` and `org.pac4j.saml` packages, based on the `javax.servlet-api` library v4) to be replaced by:
  - the `pac4j-javaee` dependency (JEE components in the `org.pac4j.jee` package, based on the `javax.servlet-api` library v4) or
  - the `pac4j-jakartaee` dependency (JEE components in the `org.pac4j.jee` package, based on the `jakarta.servlet-api` library v5)
- Refactored the SAML2 attributes conversion (from the SAML2 authn response) to rely on a defined `AttributeConverter` at the `SAML2Configuration` level
- Implemented RFC 9207 OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification in `pac4j-oidc`

**v5.3.1**:

- Added Cronofy support (OAuth v2)
- Fully fix CVE-2021-44878 by checking the OIDC response type when creating the token validator

**v5.3.0**:

- `InitializableObject`: the number of attempts and the last attempt time are tracked and checked with the max attempts and the min time interval between attempts (for the CAS implementation)
- `InitializableObject`: allow re-initialization
- Refactor the `CasOAuthWrapperClient` configuration

**v5.2.1**:

- Update `log4j-to-slf4j` and `log4j-api` to v2.17.0 although only `log4j-core` has security vulnerabilities

**v5.2.0**:

- The JEE core components are now in the `pac4j-jee` dependency (and no longer in the `pac4j-core` dependency)
- CVE-2021-44878: reinforce security on the OIDC protocol support: the `none` algorithm must be explicitly accepted on client side (`allowUnsignedIdTokens`)

**v5.1.5**:

- Fixed a NPE on the `SAML2AuthnResponseValidator`
- Added the `setExpiration(Date)` method on the `OidcProfile`
- Fixed the `expireSessionWithToken` behavior for the `OidcProfile`
- Set the `secure` and `httpOnly` flag to `true` for the CSRF cookie

- SAML2 configuration can now accept custom socket factories and hostname verification options
- Ability to ignore an existing authentication via the `loadProfilesFromSession` flag at the security filter level.

**v5.1.3**:

- Treat SAML partial logout responses as success

**v5.1.2**:

- Support SAML2 `Scoping` in authentication requests
- `WebContext` is now able to provide the request url directly

- Fixed PKCE OIDC flow support
- Properly parse SAML complex attributes
- For the CAS server OIDC support: allow to disable the checking of authentication attempts

**v5.1.0**:

- SAML2 identity provider metadata resolver can optionally be forced to download the metadata again.
- SAML2 identity provider metadata resolver is given the ability to support `last-modified` attributes for URLs.
- SAML2 response validation can now disable the validation of `authnInstant` by assigning a zero/negative value to
  `SAML2Configuration#configuration.setMaximumAuthenticationLifetime()`. This setting should not be using sparingly.
- Clients can be changed at any time in the `Clients` component

**v5.0.1**:

- Hazelcast-based implementation for SAMLMessageStore
- Added an option to tolerate missing SAML response `Destination` attribute
- SAML support: don't add the friendly name if it is the same as the (mapped) name (avoid duplication of values)
- Improve JWT parsing for nested attributes

**v5.0.0** (see: [what's new in pac4j v5?](/blog/what_s_new_in_pac4j_v5.html)):

- Upgraded to JDK 11
- Removed the `pac4j-saml-opensamlv3` and `pac4j-openid` modules
- Removed deprecated methods and classes
- Removed most generics
- Slightly refactored the auto-initialization
- Refactored the session management (mainly `ProfileManager` and `SessionStore`): reading in the web session does not create it while writing a none-null value in the session always create it. The multi-profile and save-profile-in-session-or-not options can now be defined at the `Client` level, and no longer in the "security filter" and "callback endpoint". The `get(readFromSession)` and `getAll(readFromSession)` methods of the `ProfileManager` are replaced by the `getProfile()` and `getProfiles()` methods
- The SAML central logout does not perform any local logout
- When no authorizers is defined, one of the default authorizers is `isAuthenticated` if the `AnonymousClient` is not used
- Serialize profiles in JSON (instead of using the Java serialization) for the MongoDB, SQL, LDAP and CouchDB `ProfileService` supports; Added a `JsonSerializer` and turned the `JavaSerializationHelper` into a `JavaSerializer`; Removed the `ProfileServiceSerializer`
- Removed the 307 HTTP code for a new POST request after a POST request (use 200 instead)
- Turned the `UserProfile` component into a pure interface and use it as much as possible (especially in the `JwtGenerator` and `JwtAuthenticator`)
- The `ProfileHelper.restoreOrBuildProfile` method has been removed and the behavior is controlled by the `ProfileDefinition` and its `setRestoreProfileFromTypedId` method (enabled for JWT, disabled for others)
- Authorizers and matchers can be defined additionaly with "+"
- CSRF security improvements proposed by Xhelal Likaj (https://github.com/xhlika): longer CSRF token values (32 bytes), CSRF tokens generated per HTTP request and with an internal expiration date (4 hours), CSRF token verification protected against time-based attacks
- Improved responses for unauthenticated users: 401 with "WWW-Authenticate" header or 403 to be compliant with the HTTP spec
- Default authorizers and matchers can be re-defined by users
- Separate the `SessionStore` from the `WebContext`
- Signing operations for SAML2 metadata can now be done using the existing default method or via XMLSec. The choice for the signer component can be decided via `SAML2Configuration`.
- Ability to specify the SAML2 SLO url in the `SAML2Configuration` and metadata.
- Options in `SAML2Configuration` to determine how to URLs should be compared when doing endpoint verifications with SAML2 responses.
- SAML2 logout validation can be given an expected destination so as to not just rely on the SLO endpoint defined in the SAML2 metadata.
- SAML2 requested authentication context class refs are now checked and enforced again in SAML responses.
- The presence of `NameID` elements in SAML2 responses is now made optional, if the `SAML2Configuration` is configured to build the final credential using a SAML2 attribute found in the assertion. If the attribute is not found or is undefined, `NameID` is expected as the default.
- Handle the "same site policy" in cookies (default: `lax`). Renamed `ContextHelper` as `WebContextHelper`
- Authentication requests for protocols that support forced/passive authentication can now be modified on a per-request basis using pre-defined HTTP attributes to control the type of authentication request sent to the provider.

- HTTP actions are no longer applied automatically to the web context (the `setResponseStatus` and `writeResponseContent` methods have been removed from the `WebContext` interface), an `HttpActionAdapter` must be used for that. Multiple HTTP actions (inheriting from `HttpAction`) are created to handle the necessary HTTP actions. The `RedirectAction` is replaced by the new HTTP actions inheriting from `RedirectionAction`. The `redirect` method is renamed as `getRedirectionAction`

- Properly handle states and nonces for multiple OIDC clients
- A profile can be renewed by its client when it's expired

- Add customizable SAML post Logout URL
- QualifiedName must not be included by default in SAML authentication requests
- Added replay protectection to the SAML client.
- Fix SAML signature validation w.r.t. WantAssertionsSigned handling. Signing is now always required, even when WantAssertionsSigned is disabled. WantAssertionsSigned now requires explicit signing of the assertions, not the response.
