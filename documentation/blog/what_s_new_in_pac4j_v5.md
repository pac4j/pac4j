title: What's new in pac4j v5?

One of the primary goals of pac4j has always been to be easy. One must admit that along the versions, it has gained some complexity and weight and time has come for cleaning.

Version 5 will be focused on cleaning with breaking changes as was the version 4.1 (with none-breaking changes).

The documentation will be updated too.

## Java upgrade

pac4j v5 is now based on Java 11.

## Removed

The `pac4j-saml-opensamlv3` module has been removed as it was based on JDK 8 and OpenSAML v3. It is replaced by the current `pac4j-saml` module, already based on JDK 11 and OpenSAML v4.

The `pac4j-openid` module has been removed as the OpenID protocol is no longer supported (the OpenID Connect protocol is still supported).

The `client_name` parameter can no longer be used to choose a client on the security filter. You must use the `force_client` parameter.

## Generics

While generics should have brought value to the pac4j source code, they have, in fact, cluttered it.
With inconsistencies especially in the `Clients` and `Config` components where the generics were "forgotten".

So almost all generics constraints have been removed from the source code. Only remains the generics in the `ProfileService`, `Store` and `ProfileManager` components.

## Session management

Web applications require a web session while web services generally don't need one.
These latter generally don't write into the web session, they just read from it so reads should not create a web session when it does not already exist (because of course, if the web session does not exist, the read will only return `Optional.empty()`).

Instead of explicitly requesting the use of the web session in several places (`ProfileManager`, `DefaultSecuritylogic`), the solution is to have session implementations (`SessionStore`) which don't create a new session for reads, they just try to find it back.
This way, no need to explicitly define if you want to read from the web session or not. For writes, nothing changes: a session is always created if it doesn't exist.

`profileManager.getProfiles()` replaces `profileManager.getAll(readFromSession)`

The fact that a profile is saved in the session or not after a succesful login is now override at the `Client` level, and no longer in the "security filter" and "callback endpoint". BTW, the multi-profile option is now also set at the `Client` level.

```java
client.setMultiProfile(true);
client.setSaveProfileInSession(true);
```
