  - the `pac4j-jakartaee` dependency (JEE components in the `org.pac4j.jee` package, based on the `jakarta.servlet-api` library v5)
- Refactored the SAML2 attributes conversion (from the SAML2 authn response) to rely on a defined `AttributeConverter` at the `SAML2Configuration` level
- Implemented RFC 9207 OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identification in `pac4j-oidc`

**v5.3.1**:
- Added Cronofy support (OAuth v2)
- Fully fix CVE-2021-44878 by checking the OIDC response type when creating the token validator

**v5.3.0**:
- `InitializableObject`: the number of attempts and the last attempt time are tracked and checked with the max attempts and the min time interval between attempts (for the CAS implementation)
- `InitializableObject`: allow re-initialization
- Refactor the `CasOAuthWrapperClient` configuration

**v5.2.1**:
- Update `log4j-to-slf4j` and `log4j-api` to v2.17.0 although only `log4j-core` has security vulnerabilities

**v5.2.0**:
- The JEE core components are now in the `pac4j-jee` dependency (and no longer in the `pac4j-core` dependency)
- CVE-2021-44878: reinforce security on the OIDC protocol support: the `none` algorithm must be explicitly accepted on client side (`allowUnsignedIdTokens`)

**v5.1.5**:
- Fixed a NPE on the `SAML2AuthnResponseValidator`
- Added the `setExpiration(Date)` method on the `OidcProfile`
- Fixed the `expireSessionWithToken` behavior for the `OidcProfile`
- Set the `secure` and `httpOnly` flag to `true` for the CSRF cookie

**v5.1.3**:
- Treat SAML partial logout responses as success

**v5.1.2**:
- Support SAML2 `Scoping` in authentication requests
- `WebContext` is now able to provide the request url directly

- Fixed PKCE OIDC flow support
- Properly parse SAML complex attributes
- For the CAS server OIDC support: allow to disable the checking of authentication attempts

**v5.1.0**:
- SAML2 identity provider metadata resolver can optionally be forced to download the metadata again.
- SAML2 identity provider metadata resolver is given the ability to support `last-modified` attributes for URLs.
- SAML2 response validation can now disable the validation of `authnInstant` by assigning a zero/negative value to
  `SAML2Configuration#configuration.setMaximumAuthenticationLifetime()`. This setting should not be using sparingly.
- Clients can be changed at any time in the `Clients` component

**v5.0.1**:
- Hazelcast-based implementation for SAMLMessageStore
- Added an option to tolerate missing SAML response `Destination` attribute
- SAML support: don't add the friendly name if it is the same as the (mapped) name (avoid duplication of values)
- Improve JWT parsing for nested attributes

**v5.0.0** (see: [what's new in pac4j v5?](/blog/what_s_new_in_pac4j_v5.html)):
- Upgraded to JDK 11
- Removed the `pac4j-saml-opensamlv3` and `pac4j-openid` modules
- Removed deprecated methods and classes
- Removed most generics
- Slightly refactored the auto-initialization
- Refactored the session management (mainly `ProfileManager` and `SessionStore`): reading in the web session does not create it while writing a none-null value in the session always create it. The multi-profile and save-profile-in-session-or-not options can now be defined at the `Client` level, and no longer in the "security filter" and "callback endpoint". The `get(readFromSession)` and `getAll(readFromSession)` methods of the `ProfileManager` are replaced by the `getProfile()` and `getProfiles()` methods
- The SAML central logout does not perform any local logout
- When no authorizers is defined, one of the default authorizers is `isAuthenticated` if the `AnonymousClient` is not used
- Serialize profiles in JSON (instead of using the Java serialization) for the MongoDB, SQL, LDAP and CouchDB `ProfileService` supports; Added a `JsonSerializer` and turned the `JavaSerializationHelper` into a `JavaSerializer`; Removed the `ProfileServiceSerializer`
- Removed the 307 HTTP code for a new POST request after a POST request (use 200 instead)
- Turned the `UserProfile` component into a pure interface and use it as much as possible (especially in the `JwtGenerator` and `JwtAuthenticator`)
- The `ProfileHelper.restoreOrBuildProfile` method has been removed and the behavior is controlled by the `ProfileDefinition` and its `setRestoreProfileFromTypedId` method (enabled for JWT, disabled for others)
- Authorizers and matchers can be defined additionaly with "+"
- CSRF security improvements proposed by Xhelal Likaj (https://github.com/xhlika): longer CSRF token values (32 bytes), CSRF tokens generated per HTTP request and with an internal expiration date (4 hours), CSRF token verification protected against time-based attacks
- Improved responses for unauthenticated users: 401 with "WWW-Authenticate" header or 403 to be compliant with the HTTP spec
- Default authorizers and matchers can be re-defined by users
- Separate the `SessionStore` from the `WebContext`
- Signing operations for SAML2 metadata can now be done using the existing default method or via XMLSec. The choice for the signer component can be decided via `SAML2Configuration`.
- Ability to specify the SAML2 SLO url in the `SAML2Configuration` and metadata.
- Options in `SAML2Configuration` to determine how to URLs should be compared when doing endpoint verifications with SAML2 responses.
- SAML2 logout validation can be given an expected destination so as to not just rely on the SLO endpoint defined in the SAML2 metadata.
- SAML2 requested authentication context class refs are now checked and enforced again in SAML responses.
- The presence of `NameID` elements in SAML2 responses is now made optional, if the `SAML2Configuration` is configured to build the final credential using a SAML2 attribute found in the assertion. If the attribute is not found or is undefined, `NameID` is expected as the default.
- Handle the "same site policy" in cookies (default: `lax`). Renamed `ContextHelper` as `WebContextHelper`
- Authentication requests for protocols that support forced/passive authentication can now be modified on a per-request basis using pre-defined HTTP attributes to control the type of authentication request sent to the provider.

- Add setters on `Color`
- Pull the `pac4j-saml-opensamlv3` dependency instead of the `pac4j-saml` dependency
- Remove deprecated behaviors: the retrieval of one `CommonProfile` in request or session via the `ProfileManager` and the retrieval of a `String` as the requested URL

- For `Google2Client`, change profile URL from `https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/people/me` to `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo`. This change is to prepare for the shutdown of Google plus API. This change will remove the `birthday` and `emails` attribute for `Google2Client`.
- For an AJAX request, only generates the redirection URL when requested (`addRedirectionUrlAsHeader` property of the `DefaultAjaxRequestResolver`)
- Updated the APIs to use `Optional` instead of returning `null`
- Use the 303 "See Other" and 307 "Temporary Redirect" HTTP actions after a POST request (`RedirectionActionHelper`)
- Handles originally requested URLs with POST method

- Properly handle states and nonces for multiple OIDC clients
- A profile can be renewed by its client when it's expired
- Most web authorizers are now matchers. The default matchers are "securityHeaders,csrfToken" and the default authorizer is "csrfCheck". Use "none" for no matcher or authorizer
- Use the `FindBest` utility class to find the best adapter, logic...
- Support for the OIDC back-channel and front-channel logouts
- Load the profiles in the `ProfileManager` (from the session or not) like in the `DefaultSecurityLogic` via the `getLikeDefaultSecurityLogic` and `getAllLikeDefaultSecurityLogic` methods
